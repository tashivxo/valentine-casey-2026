Sprouting out the earth full of life, tendrils reaching for the sky
Skyline a deep passionate blue caressed by a fiery ball of fury upon the horizon
Sun-kissed skin adorned with my fingerprints
Powdery petals that stand tall like a crown fit for a queen but worn by the divine feminine 
The sensation sauntering throughout the chambers in the muscle pumping under my sternum
How euphoric the sensation the flowerchuld entices me
Dancing on the winds of freedoms gaze
More melodic than any hymn ever made
More serene than any renaissance masterpiece
My flower child stands tall and proud as whiffs of her nectar fills my nostrils
Her seeds planted in my soul
